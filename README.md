# 🚀 SaaSland – Forked & Customized

This project is a **successful fork and custom adaptation** of the excellent [SaaSland – SaaS & Startup React JS Template](https://themewagon.com/themes/saasland/), originally distributed by [ThemeWagon](https://themewagon.com) and authored by [Codescandy](https://codescandy.com/).

## About This Project

- Based on the SaaSland React/Vite template, then extensively customized
- Modernized dependencies (React 19, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, ESLint 9)
- New file structure, updated components, and sections tailored for my needs
- Enhanced workflow and scripts for development and deployment

## Getting Started

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **For a production build:**  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. **To preview the production build locally:**
